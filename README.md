# dotfiles

This repo contains my dotfiles configuration. These days I primarily use GNU/Linux via the Fedora Linux distribution.

I manage the various configuration files in this repo using <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/">GNU Stow</a>. This allows me to set up symlinks for all of my dotfiles efficiently.
